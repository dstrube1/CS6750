For the purpose of the evaluation of this prototype, please imagine you are using the dive tending UI on a mobile phone. See the linked screenshots of how this UI looks on an Android Moto X4 for example.

I have viewed the screenshot of the current UI and I can imagining using it on a mobile phone.

Now imagine you are presented with the option of using this UI with the following prototype instead.

I have viewed the wireframe prototype UI


The three horizontal bars in the top left (the "hamburger" icon) functions the same way as it does in the current UI. The fields like "[    Dive site    ]", "[    Date    ]", and "[    Name    ]" are filled in from a previous screen or by selecting divers. Dive type is only selected one time (as most dives aren't a mix of SCUBA and Surface Supply). A new diver is added by clicking the + icon and removed by clicking the - icon. Likewise, a tank is added by clicking its + icon and removed by clicking its - icon. Selecting a diver populates the fields tied to that diver, same as it does in the current UI. The Complete button has been moved to the bottom and a Cancel button has been added. 

I understand;I don't understand
