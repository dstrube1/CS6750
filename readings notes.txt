DesignofEverydayThings-Ch1:
Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? 
Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?
	-Industrial designers emphasize form and material
	-Interaction designers emphasize understandability and usability
	-Experience designers emphasize the emotional impact
Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology
Must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors
-Human-centered design (HCD): puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first
	-People are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are encountering. 
	-Getting the specification of the thing to be defined is one of the most difficult parts of the design
	-Avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations
	-Rapid tests of ideas, and after each test modifying the approach and the problem definition
Discoverability results from:
	-affordances: relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used; what is it for? what can be done with it? Affordance is not a property. An affordance is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both the object and the agent. Affordances and anti-affordances have to be discoverable. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required->
	-signifiers: signaling component of affordances. Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. 
	"If we are fortunate, thoughtful designers provide the clues for us. Otherwise, we must use our own creativity and imagination."
	-constraints: [covered later - how things don't work? scissors held the wrong way?]
	-mappings: relationship between the elements of two sets of things; raised hand=more => raised knob to increase volume; light switches arranged similar to placement of lights 
	-feedback: some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request. Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all. Too much feedback can be more annoying than too little.
	-conceptual model of the system: highly simplified explanation of how something works
The Paradox of Technology: tech makes our lives better and worse

Norman-CognitiveEngineering:
Cognitive Engineering: trying to apply what is known from science to the design and construction of machines
goals: understand the issues, show how to make better choices when they exist, and to show what the tradeoffs are
Task complexity: 
	even a task that has but a single mechanism to control a single variable can be difficult to understand, to learn, and to do
	correct conceptual model can transform confusing, difficult tasks into simple, straightforward ones
Psychological Variables Differ From Physical Variables
Faucet design is an example of how technology responded to provide control over psychological variables instead of physical ones
Even Simple Tasks Involve a Large Number of Aspects
Goals give rise to intentions to satisfy the goals
Physical system state S has variables V and mechanisms M for control
difference between desired goal and current state gives rise to an intention => action sequence
each physical variable might be affected by an interaction of the control mechanisms:
Vn = f(Ma,Mb)
system state, S is a function of all its variables:
S = h(Va,Vb)
A THEORY OF ACTION
The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
user has goals in psychological terms; system has current state in physical terms
user creates plans, action sequences, and interpretations 
[Screen Shot 2021-06-20 at 13.18.35]
Bridging gap from goals to physical system: 
	1- intention formation, 
	2- specifying the action sequence, 
	3- executing the action, 
	4- making contact with the input mechanisms of the interface
some physical actions are more difficult than others => 
	the choice of input devices can affect the selection of actions => 
	affects how well the system matches with intentions
[Screen Shot 2021-06-21 at 00.24.17]
Practical Implications:
	a critical requirement for the design of the interface: to bridge the gap between goals and system
	only two ways to do this: move the system closer to the user; move the user closer to the system
